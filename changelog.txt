Changed calls to romview-w.exe and romview-l to romview.exe and romview, for Windows and Linux, respectively.
Added write instructions for the [graphics] section (for video drivers) to write to all three config files. 

Segregated all calls to ag.cfg:
	All calls to ag.cfg have been segregated as follows:
	Calls specific to ZC read and write to zc.cfg.
	Calls specific to ZQuest read and write to zquest.cfg.
	Calls for ROMView, and all calls made for ZCL-specific sections
	( section 'ZCL' and section 'graphics' ) read and write to ag.cfg. ( ZoriaRPG, 6th October, 2017 )

Removed the -w and -l filename tags for the binaries.
	The compiler output for ZC outputs zelda.exe, and zquest.ext, romview.exe
	on windows, and zelda, zquest, and romview for Linux and OSX.

	The change uses the filenames from the compiler output.
	(MacOSX versions will follow this format.)

	The change is:
	zelda-w.exe -> zelda.exe
	zquest-w.exe -> zquest.exe
	zelda-l -> zelda
	zquest-l -> zquest

	This should speed up some testing, as the filename changes are time-consuming. ( ZoriaRPG, 6th October, 2017 )

More to come ;) -Sean ( Sean, 2014-07-01 18:14:05 )

The source code has been updated for Lazarus 0.9.28.2. I was still using 0.9.22 so it needed updated so that means I'm also using the new fpc compiler. ( Sean, 2010-02-01 04:58:47 )
