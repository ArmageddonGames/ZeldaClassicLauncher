	ZLaunch (or ZCLaunch, ZCL) is an open source launcher programme designed to run the Zelda Classic
	suite of programmes: Zelda Classic, ZQuest (quest editor), and ROMView (graphics extractor for
	NES/FC and SNES/SFC games).
	
	It is designed to set the various configuration properties of each programme, that are normally
	set in the 'ag.cfg' (Allegro 4 config) file, using a graphical user interface for Windows and Linux
	systems. No MacOS X version of ZCL has been released to date. 
	
	The utility itself is coded in FreePascal, and was designed in the Lazarus IDE.
	
	Binaries for release are compressed with UPX.
	
	Please also see the Zelda Classic open source project at:

	ZCL was originally programmed by Deviance on AGN, and has been released under the GPL v3 license.
